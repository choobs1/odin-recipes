    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>4 Table spoons of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 large onions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 table spoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>16 ounce package elbow Macaroni</li>
        <li>2 table spoon all purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 cup beef broth</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>1 pinch freshly grated nutmeg to taste</li>
        <li>Three quarters shredded Gruyere cheese</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <p>
    <ol>
        <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
            Cook and stir onions, thyme, and bay leaf in the butter for 5 minutes; season with salt and pepper.
            Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook until onions are browned, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer to a plate and
            discard the bay leaf.
            Reserve the skillet.
        </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8
            minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Meanwhile, melt remaining butter in the reserved skillet over medium heat.
            Whisk in flour for 1 minute, then whisk in beef broth and milk and bring to a boil; season with nutmeg,
            salt, and pepper.
            Reduce heat and cook until thickened, about 5 minutes.
            Stir in Gruyere cheese until melted.
        </li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and toss with onion and sauce until well combined.</li>
    </ol>
